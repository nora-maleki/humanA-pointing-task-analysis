	A series of neurological and philosophical discussions has led to suggestions that space is a model of the environment, constructed from the temporal integration of successive perceptions, which model man as neurologically disposed to create and organize. The model is coordinated to social conventions. It develops and is vulnerable to dissolution. Studies of adults' knowledge about their macroenvironment suggest that human “maps” are not literally maps. Rather, they tend to be fragmented, distorted projectively, and are often several multiple “mini-spatial-representations.” Landmarks and routes are the minimal elements of spatial representation. Survey-representations incorporate configurational elements (outlines, graphic skeletons, figurative metaphors) and may be the final derivative of dense, richly interconnected, and hierarchically organized route maps. The notion of “main sequences” was introduced as a potential explanation for the extensive parallelisms identified among ontogenesis, microgenesis, the course of pathology, and the recovery of function following pathological insult. The development of the sequence of spatial representations in children conforms to the “main sequence” identified in the construction of spatial representation in adults.}
