\chapter{Methodology}

\section{Experimental Design}

\todo{
	- are there any questionnaires used in the study? \\
}

\subsection{City}

This study is conducted in a virtual reality (VR) city with the area of about \todo{1 km\textsuperscript2}. The city is consisted of \todo{\# of buildings} buildings, from which 4 are landmarks. 56 of the buildings are used in the experimental task of this study. 28 are shops {\emphasize(context meaningful)} and 28 are normal buildings {\emphasize(not context meaningful)} \todo{are these numbers correct? the landmarks are also in task, right?}. These 56 buildings are distinguishable by the avatars \todo{[or agents?]} in front of them and an artwork on one of their walls. Avatars belonging to shops take the pose of an act according to the functionality of that store {\emphasize(meaningful)}, e.g., has a book in the hand in front of a bookstore, or are just standing in front of the building {\emphasize(standing avatar)}. The artworks on the shops are also depicting the kind of the shop.

\todo{
	- FIG: include a map \\
}

\subsection{Application and Technology}
\todo{
	- option of English or German \\
	- participant id \\
	- unity version  \\
	- blender version  \\
	- htc vive headset \\
	- SRanipal version \\
	- index valve controller \\
}

\section{Exploration}
\todo{
	- 5 exploration sessions \\
	- each session 30 minutes \\ 
	- free walking and exploring  \\
	- sitting on a chair \\
	- walking via joystick, rotation via body \\
}

\section{Experimental procedure}

\todo{
	- 1 experimental session [mean duration?]  \\
	- tutorial  \\
	- blocks \\
	- randomization \\ 
	- number of the whole trials [336?] \\
	- calibrate, validate eye tracker [how many times?] \\
	- [when is the pause?] \\
	- trial's procedure details \\
	- 30s max length of trial \\
	- add the time of countdown appearance
	- laser beam  \\
	- horizontal movement is locked. Only rotation on the chair they are sitting on is allowed \\
	- photos from buildings with and without avatars (target to point to) \\
	- ability to center the photo \\
	- cancellation and confirmation of the selected direction  \\
	- avatars are present in the city during the task \\
	- 28 starting locations that are spread throughout the city are used for the tasks \\
	- using fade when transporting participants to another location to avoid inducing motion sickness and leaking environmental information \\
	- eye tracking data is gathered  \\
	- behavioral data is gathered \\
	- include photo  \\
}

\section{Participants}
\todo{
	- total number of participants \\
	- gender \\
	- average + standard deviation of age \\
	- [were all of them uni students?] \\
	- written consent \\
	- compensation \\
	- whether anyone was excluded (if yes, why?) \\
	- due to Covid-19 pandemic sessions are conducted according to the laboratory hygiene regulations and with a mask [under 2G rule?] \\
}

\section{Analysis method}
\todo{
	- preprocessing
	- trial removal criteria \\
	- check the assumptions for analysis? \\
	- linear mixed models (anova parameters: depvar='absolute\_180\_angles', subject='subject\_id', within=['starting\_loc\_id']) \\
	- maybe the analysis can be done also with RT as dependent variable? \\
	- maybe other analysis methods
