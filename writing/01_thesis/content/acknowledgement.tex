\chapter*{Acknowledgements}\label{cha:acknowledgement}


First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, M.Sc. Tracy Sánchez Pacheco for her patience, guidance, and understanding, not only during this supervision but since the time I got the honor to get to know her and learn from her.

I would like to thank Tracy and Prof. Dr. Pipa for giving me the opportunity to work on this project and for their help and support.

It is close to five years since I last had the chance to be with my family. There is no possibility to thank them enough for consistently giving me their infinite love and support from another side of the world, helping me through ups and downs, and helping me get here, to where I am today.

I would like to thank Linus and Özge for being there for me with their love and support.

Last but definitely not least, I would like to thank Tracy Sánchez Pacheco, Kaya Gärtner, and Mohammad Ghorbani for gathering the data used in this thesis, which without this work would not have been possible.
